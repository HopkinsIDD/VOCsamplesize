\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics{../figures/FigS1.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption*{\textbf{Figure S1. Factors resulting in enrichment of observed variant prevalence.} VOC prevalence in (\textbf{A}) total population, (\textbf{B}) pool of detected infections, and (\textbf{C}) characterized infections (identified as a particular variant by sequencing or another technology). Biological differences between variants can lead to enrichment of VOC in observed variant proportions. Orange = infections caused by VOC (variant of concern); blue = infections caused by other variants of the same pathogen.}

    \includegraphics{../figures/FigS2.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption*{\textbf{Figure S2. Parameters affecting the coefficient of detection.} Factors affecting the variant of concern (VOC) prevalence in the sample of detected infections. In (\textbf{A}), a VOC (orange) causes more symptomatic (filled circle) infections (lower asymptomatic rate) than the rest of the pathogen population (blue). Assuming the testing probability is higher for individuals presenting symptoms than asymptomatic individuals, this leads to an artificial enrichment of the VOC in the pool of detected infections, since individuals infected with this variant are more likely to be tested and therefore sampled. Enrichment of a variant in a sample corresponds to a coefficient of detection ratio ($\frac{C_{V_1}}{C_{V_2}}$) that is greater than one. In (\textbf{B}), a VOC (orange) results in lower sensitivity of diagnostic tests, perhaps because it causes a lower viral load than the pathogen variant infecting the rest of the population (blue). In this case, the pool of detected infections is enriched for non-VOC samples, corresponding to a coefficient of detection ratio ($\frac{C_{V_1}}{C_{V_2}}$) of less than one.}

  \caption*{\textbf{Figure S3. Validation of the binomial sampling approximation.} Variant prevalence estimates (x-axis) from 1,000 simulations of our model for each combination of variant prevalence ($P_{V_1}$) (rows) and sampling proportion (columns). Simulations each assume 10,000 infected individuals in the population and $C_{V_1}=C_{V_2}=0.114$, resulting in 1,140 high quality detected infections ($H$) from which to sample. In each simulation, =0.8 and infections that progress between model states are selected stochastically using a binomial process. Blue lines = binomial distribution (i.e., sampling with replacement, an approximation of the simulated sampling process) given stated sampling fraction (from $H$) and variant prevalence; green dotted lines = hypergeometric distribution (i.e., sampling without replacement, the exact sampling process) given stated sampling fraction and variant prevalence; red vertical lines = marker of input variant frequency. The binomial distribution approximates the simulated process well, except when nearly all detected infections are sampled (as expected) or the variant prevalence is very low.}

  \caption*{\textbf{Figure S4. Sample size needed for variant detection and prevalence estimation with 50\% confidence.} (\textbf{A}) Number of sequences required to detect at least one infection caused by $V_1$ with 50\% probability, for different $V_1$ prevalence values and coefficient of detection ratios. (\textbf{B}) Number of sequences required to determine the prevalence of variants with a frequency of at least $P_{V_1}$ in the population, with 50\% confidence and 25\% precision. (\textbf{C}) Same as (B), but with 50\% confidence and 10\% precision. The calculated prevalence in (B) and (C) will reflect the observed (biased) value, and will need to be corrected using (\textbf{Equation 6}). These figures assumes a two-variant system, where $V_1$ is the variant of interest and $V_2$ is the rest of the pathogen population. In all panels, note that the number of samples selected for sequencing should exceed the number of sequences required if $\omega <1$.}

  \caption*{\textbf{Figure S5. Sample size needed for detection of a variant growing in prevalence.} Probability of detecting at least one infection caused by $V_1$ (yellow = 0\% probability; blue = 100\% probability) on or before a specific day (bottom x-axis) or desired prevalence (top x-axis), given per-day sample size, specified coefficient of detection ratio, and the following growth rate and initial variant prevalence values: (\textbf{A-B}) Growth rate = 0.05, initial prevalence = 1/10000. (\textbf{C-D}) Growth rate = 0.1, initial prevalence = 5/10000. Note that the desired prevalence (top x-axis) is the actual variant prevalence in the population and that the number of samples selected for sequencing should exceed the number of sequences required if $\omega<1$. 50\% and 95\% probability of detection contours are indicated on all panels.}
